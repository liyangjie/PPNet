# PPNet
# Identifying functional association networks by phylogenetic profiling of prokaryotic genomes

## Introduction
- **What is PPNet?**
PPNet is designed to uses genome information and analysis of phylogenetic profiles with binary similarity and distance measures to derive large-scale bacterial association networks of a single species.

## Installation
PPNet has the following dependencies:
* [prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka)
* [roary](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Roary)
* Python(>=version 3.7)




- **Install with the source codes**
git clone https://github.com/liyangjie/PPNet.git
